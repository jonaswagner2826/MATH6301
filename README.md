# MATH6301 - Real Analysis I
This repository consists of my work done for MATH 6301 - Real Analysis I at The University of Texas at Dallas in Fall 2022.



It is worth noting that A LOT of my work is incorrect and that I barely passed the course. 
(i.e. don't rely on any of my answers for anything important)
